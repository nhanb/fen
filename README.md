Fen is a virtual fren on your desktop. It works on any platform that [godot][1]
works on, which are Windows, Linux, macOS and the nerdier BSDs.

[Demo video here][2] (there's sound).

I have no idea what I'm doing, so YMMV.

Eventually it'll probably end up a cross-platform [shimeji][3] clone, if my
zoomer attention span doesn't give up first.

Demo sprites were ripped (poorly) from [taninao's twitter][4].

Some 64bit builds with sha1 checksums:
